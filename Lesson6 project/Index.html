				An article from National Geographic website has caught my attention 
				about the laws for selling meat. The article titled “Proposed Lion-Meat 
				Ban Shines Light on Wild-Animal Meat” by Christine Dell'Amore published 
				on March 12, 2013, talks about the production and selling of lion meat and 
				other exotic animals. Illinois representative Luis Arroyo brought attention 
				to this market of exotic foods through his proposed Lion Meat Act, after 
				African lion (also called Panthera leo) meat was found being sold in restaurants. 
				The reason restaurants were able to sell lion meat because there are no laws 
				prohibiting the breeding and trade of lions. Some people argue that thousands 
				of cows are killed for beef, while only a few lions are killed for their meat. 
				On the other hand there is a bigger cow population than the shrinking African lion 
				population. Also, lions are carnivores so there is an increased chance that the lion 
				consumed many different animals leading to parasites and diseases, tainting its meat. 
				Lion meat is not the only exotic meat being sold, other animals are also being eaten, 
				such as: iguana, llama, camel, emu, and snapping turtle.
